Problem3.Virtual circuit networks most certainly need this capability in order to route connection setup packets from an arbitrary source to an arbitrary destination.

Problem4.The negotiation could set the window size, maximum packet size, data rate, and timer values.

Problem7.It will follow all of the following routes: ABCD, ABCF, ABEF, ABEG, AGHD, AGHF, AGEB, and AGEF. The number of hops used is 24.

Problem10.The routing table is 400 bits. Twice a second this table is written onto each line, so 800 bps are needed on each line in each direction.
