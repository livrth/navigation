Chaude and Cold
　　A patron in Montreal cafe turned on a tap in the washroom and got scalded. "This is an outrage," he complained. "The faucet marked C gave me boiling water."
　　"But, Monsieur, C stands for chaude - French for hot. You should know that if you live in Montreal."
　　"Wait a minute," roared the patron. "The other tap is also marked C."
　　"Of course," said the manager, "It stands for cold. After all, Montreal is a bilingual city."
